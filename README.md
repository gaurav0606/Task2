rpcalc
======
A reverse polish notation calculator written in Python 3.


## About
rpcalc is a stack-based [reverse polish notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calculator based on the [HP 11C Scientific Calculator](http://www.hpmuseum.org/hp11c.htm) with extended features, such as:

- An advanced stack datatype with native floating-point precision
- Choice of unlimited or limited stack length (see [Command-Line Switches](#command-line-switches))
- User-extendible operators with simple, familiar syntax

## Installation and Execution
You will need Python 3.3 or higher to run rpcalc.

### Archlinux
The latest stable version of rpcalc is available on the AUR as [rpcalc-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rpcalc-git/). Install it as you would [any other AUR software](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages).

### All other systems
I am working to put rpcalc on many repositories of various linux distributions. Until then, simply download the necessary files from the [git repository](http://github.com/qguv/rpcalc/).

### Installing
Switch to the rpcalc directory, and run the following from a command shell:

    python3 setup.py install

It is possible that your system calls your Python 3.3 binary something different, such as `python` (ArchLinux) or `py33.exe` (some Windows). If this is the case, replace `python3` in the above example with the proper executable.

rpcalc should now be installed. Type rpcalc into a command shell to run it.

### Running rpcalc for Testing
If you would prefer _not_ to install rpcalc to your system, follow these instructions.

Switch to the rpcalc directory, and run the following from a command shell:

    python3 rpcalc.py

It is possible that your system calls your Python 3.3 binary something different, such as `python` (ArchLinux) or `py33.exe` (some Windows). If this is the case, replace `python3` in the above example with the proper executable.

## Operation
rpcalc uses a stack for all operations. Users unfamiliar with RPN or stack-based calculation are encouraged to read [**Basic Example**](#basic-example) below and a [general RPN tutorial](http://glow.sourceforge.net/tutorial/lesson7/side_rpn.html) (short and sweet).

### Basic Example
To multiply seven by the sum of two and one million:

- Type `2` `Enter`. This puts two into the stack.
- Type `1e6` `+`. This adds what you just typed with the most recent stack entry.
- Type `7` `x`. This multiplies seven with the result of the last calculation.

Your result, `7000014.0`, is now the only entry in the stack. You can confirm this by pressing `p` or `#`.

### Concepts
- Numbers are pushed into the stack once `Enter` is pressed or an operation is entered.
- Operations are executed as soon as they are typed; **do not** follow operations with `Enter`.
- There is no artificial limit placed on stack length.
- If in doubt, use the program as you would an 11C, if you are familiar with its operation.

### Operators
_The most recent and second-most recent stack entries will be denoted_ x _and_ y _respectively. You can always peek inside operators.py for a more objective explanation of these functions._

#### Program
- `?` - enter interactive help mode
- `p` - prints the stack
- `Q` - quits the program, **no matter what**

#### Stack
- `D` - drops _x_ and pushes stack items to compensate
- `C` - clears the stack
- `#` - displays a message with the current stack length (does not push anything to the stack)
- `w` - swaps _x_ and _y_
- `Enter` (while no number is being entered) - duplicates _x_ and pushes it

#### Arithmetic
- `+` `-` `*` `/` - basic arithmetic operations
- `x` - shortcut for `*`
- `n` - returns ( _x_ * -1 )
- `%` - returns the remainder of the division of _y_ by _x_
- `f` - floor-rounds _x_ to an integer
- `ln` - returns the natural log of the most recent stack entry ( _x_ )
- `^` - returns _y_ to the _xth_ power
- `sqrt` - returns the square root of _x_
- `abs` - returns the absolute value of _x_
- `!` - returns the factorial of _x_

#### Sequence Operators
- `S` - returns the sum of all stack entries
- `P` - returns the product of all stack entries

#### Statistics
- `mean` - returns the arithmetic mean of all stack entries
- `med` - returns the median of all stack entries

#### Constants
_in rpcalc, constant operators begin with `k` to prevent conflicts with other operators_

- `ke` - returns [Euler's number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28mathematical_constant%29): the base of the natural logarithm and the exponential function
- `kpi` - returns [pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi): the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter

#### Logic
- `==` - returns 1 if _x_ is equal to _y_, otherwise returns 0
- `=!` - returns 0 if _x_ is equal to _y_, otherwise returns 1
- `<` - returns 1 if _y_ is less than _x_, otherwise returns 0
- `>` - returns 1 if _y_ is greater than _x_, otherwise returns 0
- `=<` - returns 1 if _y_ is less than or equal to _x_, otherwise returns 0
- `=>` - returns 1 if _y_ is greater than or equal to _x_, otherwise returns 0

#### Trigonometry
- `deg` - converts _x_ (radians) to degrees
- `rad` - converts _x_ (degrees) to radians
- `sin` - returns the sine of _x_ (radians)
- `cos` - returns the cosine of _x_ (radians)
- `tan` - returns the tangent of _x_ (radians)
- `asin` - returns the arcsine of _x_ (radians)
- `acos` - returns the arccosine of _x_ (radians)
- `atan` - returns the arctangent of _x_ (radians)

#### Other
- `rand` - returns a random number between 0 and 1

Other operations can easily be added by modifying `operators.py`.

### Examples
_Results are designated with `>>>`, but these are really stored in the stack and displayed only because they are the current_ x _value._

    1 Enter 2 +
    >>> 3.0

    2 Enter Enter Enter * *
    >>> 8.0
    
    10 ln
    >>> 2.302585092994046
    
    256 ln 2 ln /
    >>> 8.0
    
    2 Enter 256 ln w ln /
    >>> 8.0
    
    2 Enter 3 ==
    >>> 0
    
    2 Enter Enter ==
    >>> 1

## Command-Line Switches
- `-s` or `--stack-size` - limits the stack size to the integer provided. Empty stack entries become 0 when using a limited-size stack.
- `-i` or `--initial-values` - takes space-separated numbers and pushes them to the stack.
- `-e` or `--exclusive` - sets the stack length to the amount of numbers provided with `-i`


## FAQ
> **I found a bug! Let me email that to you...**

Thank you, but please don't email me the bug! Make sure it's not a [known issue](#known-issues), and write me a bug report [here](https://github.com/qguv/rpcalc/issues/new) or if you're familiar with git: fork, fix, and file a pull request.

> **How do I do log base _x_?**

A `log` function is not scheduled to be implemented because the functionality is _already there_ and because there is no reason to memorize which stack item will be the base and on which item the log will operate.

You will need to use the _change of base formula_:

![Logarithmic Change of Base Formula](https://raw.github.com/qguv/rpcalc/master/resources/logCOB.png)

    256 ln 2 ln /

> **There's `mean` and `med`, so why are there no _mode_, _maximum_, or _minimum_ operators?**

Arithmetic mean and median return one result, which is pushed into the stack. Mode, maximum, and minimum all have the capacity to produce more than one result. There is no non-arbitrary method of deciding the order in which the multiple answers would be pushed into the stack. Answers like these would be no good if the user didn't know which answer s/he wanted or where it went in the stack. Procedurally, these functions would be easy to write, but there is no clear way to display the answer to the user.

### Known Issues
- Some of the operators defined in operators.py still have `#DEBUG` tags. This is intentional; these operators will be removed once rpcalc graduates from version zero.


### Motivation
At time of writing (August 2013), no stack-based RPN existed with the features and extensibility for which the author was looking. This project is meant to be a test of git, GitHub, vim, Python 3, and Object-Oriented Programming in general.
